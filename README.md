# Pomodoro Timer

This Pomodro Timer (or Pomodoro Clock) can be viewed at https://codepen.io/derbergfex/full/GypPLN/

Information on the Pomodoro Technique can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique

This repository contains the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code files for 'Build a Pomodoro Clock', FreeCodeCamp's second advanced
front-end web development project. The first timer, from the top, initially set to 25 minutes, is the work timer; and the second timer, initially set to 5 minutes, is the break timer. The user may well edit the time for either timer. A beeping sound can be observed for each timer once its time is over. 

This project was built mainly to develop JavaScript algorithim-scripting skills, and hence
why the CSS and the HTML are very minimal. To edit or add features to the web app on CodePen, simply press the 'Fork' button on the top-right side of the page.
