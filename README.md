# Pomodoro-Timer

This Pomodro Timer (or Pomodoro Clock) can be viewed at https://codepen.io/derbergfex/full/GypPLN/

This repository contains the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code files for 'Build a Pomodoro Clock', FreeCodeCamp's second advanced
front-end web development project. This project was built mainly to develop JavaScript algorithim-scripting skills, and hence
why the CSS and the HTML are very minimal.
